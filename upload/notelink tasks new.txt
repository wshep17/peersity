When the user clicks the request a tutor button, it works like a queue,
in that it waits for another user to accept his request. When that user (the tutor)
accepts his request, they will both be brought to the same chat room.
There is a queue page where the tutor clicks a student, and when the tutor clicks the student,
the tutor is brought to a random chat url and the student is also brought to that url

Approaches:
Approach 1:
add fields 'isTaken' (boolean) and url for chat room 'chaturl' (string) and add those to a student profile
tick isTaken true if student gets connected with tutor in the chat room, otherwise false
